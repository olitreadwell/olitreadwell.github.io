      <h2>I let it breathe even more</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shirty website you're building. Assuming
        they're not married, they probably shouldn't be humming. The defaults
        are trash â€• pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy.
        Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that... prance off. If your
        text hits the side of the browser, fork off forever. Have you ever seen
        a book like that? Yes? What a shirty book." -
